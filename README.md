## App startup

### Complete Transactions

Apple recommends to register a transaction observer [as soon as the app starts](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2387/_index.html):
> Adding your app's observer at launch ensures that it will persist during all launches of your app, thus allowing your app to receive all the payment queue notifications.

SwiftyStoreKit supports this by calling `completeTransactions()` when the app starts:

```swift
func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {

	SwiftyStoreKit.completeTransactions(atomically: true) { products in
	
	    for product in products {
	
	        if product.transaction.transactionState == .purchased || product.transaction.transactionState == .restored {
	
               if product.needsFinishTransaction {
                   // Deliver content from server, then:
                   SwiftyStoreKit.finishTransaction(product.transaction)
               }
               print("purchased: \(product)")
	        }
	    }
	}
 	return true
}
```

If there are any pending transactions at this point, these will be reported by the completion block so that the app state and UI can be updated.

## Purchases

### Retrieve products info
```swift
SwiftyStoreKit.retrieveProductsInfo(["com.musevisions.SwiftyStoreKit.Purchase1"]) { result in
    if let product = result.retrievedProducts.first {
        let priceString = product.localizedPrice!
        print("Product: \(product.localizedDescription), price: \(priceString)")
    }
    else if let invalidProductId = result.invalidProductIDs.first {
        return alertWithTitle("Could not retrieve product info", message: "Invalid product identifier: \(invalidProductId)")
    }
    else {
	     print("Error: \(result.error)")
    }
}
```

### Purchase a product

* **Atomic**: to be used when the content is delivered immediately.

```swift
SwiftyStoreKit.purchaseProduct("com.musevisions.SwiftyStoreKit.Purchase1", atomically: true) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let product):
        print("Purchase Success: \(product.productId)")
    case .error(let error):
        switch error.code {
        case .unknown: print("Unknown error. Please contact support")
        case .clientInvalid: print("Not allowed to make the payment")
        case .paymentCancelled: break
        case .paymentInvalid: print("The purchase identifier was invalid")
        case .paymentNotAllowed: print("The device is not allowed to make the payment")
        case .storeProductNotAvailable: print("The product is not available in the current storefront")
        case .cloudServicePermissionDenied: print("Access to cloud service information is not allowed")
        case .cloudServiceNetworkConnectionFailed: print("Could not connect to the network")
        }
    }
}
```

* **Non-Atomic**: to be used when the content is delivered by the server.

```swift
SwiftyStoreKit.purchaseProduct("com.musevisions.SwiftyStoreKit.Purchase1", atomically: false) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let product):
        // fetch content from your server, then:
        if product.needsFinishTransaction {
            SwiftyStoreKit.finishTransaction(product.transaction)
        }
        print("Purchase Success: \(product.productId)")
    case .error(let error):
        switch error.code {
        case .unknown: print("Unknown error. Please contact support")
        case .clientInvalid: print("Not allowed to make the payment")
        case .paymentCancelled: break
        case .paymentInvalid: print("The purchase identifier was invalid")
        case .paymentNotAllowed: print("The device is not allowed to make the payment")
        case .storeProductNotAvailable: print("The product is not available in the current storefront")
        case .cloudServicePermissionDenied: print("Access to cloud service information is not allowed")
        case .cloudServiceNetworkConnectionFailed: print("Could not connect to the network")
        }
    }
}
```

### Restore previous purchases

* **Atomic**: to be used when the content is delivered immediately.

```swift
SwiftyStoreKit.restorePurchases(atomically: true) { results in
    if results.restoreFailedProducts.count > 0 {
        print("Restore Failed: \(results.restoreFailedProducts)")
    }
    else if results.restoredProducts.count > 0 {
        print("Restore Success: \(results.restoredProducts)")
    }
    else {
        print("Nothing to Restore")
    }
}
```

* **Non-Atomic**: to be used when the content is delivered by the server.

```swift
SwiftyStoreKit.restorePurchases(atomically: false) { results in
    if results.restoreFailedProducts.count > 0 {
        print("Restore Failed: \(results.restoreFailedProducts)")
    }
    else if results.restoredProducts.count > 0 {
        for product in results.restoredProducts {
            // fetch content from your server, then:
            if product.needsFinishTransaction {
                SwiftyStoreKit.finishTransaction(product.transaction)
            }
        }
        print("Restore Success: \(results.restoredProducts)")
    }
    else {
        print("Nothing to Restore")
    }
}
```

#### What does atomic / non-atomic mean?

When you purchase a product the following things happen:

* A payment is added to the payment queue for your IAP.
* When the payment has been processed with Apple, the payment queue is updated so that the appropriate transaction can be handled.
* If the transaction state is **purchased** or **restored**, the app can unlock the functionality purchased by the user.
* The app should call `finishTransaction()` to complete the purchase.

This is what is [recommended by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/reference/storekit/skpaymentqueue/1506003-finishtransaction):

> Your application should call finishTransaction(_:) only after it has successfully processed the transaction and unlocked the functionality purchased by the user.

* A purchase is **atomic** when the app unlocks the functionality purchased by the user immediately and call `finishTransaction()` at the same time. This is desirable if you're unlocking functionality that is already inside the app.

* In cases when you need to make a request to your own server in order to unlock the functionality, you can use a **non-atomic** purchase instead.

* **Note**: SwiftyStoreKit doesn't yet support downloading content hosted by Apple for non-consumable products. See [this feature request](https://github.com/bizz84/SwiftyStoreKit/issues/128).

SwiftyStoreKit provides three operations that can be performed **atomically** or **non-atomically**:

* Making a purchase
* Restoring purchases
* Completing transactions on app launch

## Receipt verification

### Retrieve local receipt

```swift
let receiptData = SwiftyStoreKit.localReceiptData
let receiptString = receiptData.base64EncodedString(options: [])
// do your receipt validation here
```

### Verify Receipt

```swift
let appleValidator = AppleReceiptValidator(service: .production)
SwiftyStoreKit.verifyReceipt(using: appleValidator, password: "your-shared-secret") { result in
    if case .error(let error) = result {
        if case .noReceiptData = error {
            self.refreshReceipt()
        }
    }
}

func refreshReceipt() {
    SwiftyStoreKit.refreshReceipt { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let receiptData):
            print("Receipt refresh success: \(receiptData.base64EncodedString)")
        case .error(let error):
            print("Receipt refresh failed: \(error)")
        }
    }
}
```

### Verify Purchase

```swift
let appleValidator = AppleReceiptValidator(service: .production)
SwiftyStoreKit.verifyReceipt(using: appleValidator, password: "your-shared-secret") { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let receipt):
        // Verify the purchase of Consumable or NonConsumable
        let purchaseResult = SwiftyStoreKit.verifyPurchase(
            productId: "com.musevisions.SwiftyStoreKit.Purchase1",
            inReceipt: receipt
        )
        switch purchaseResult {
        case .purchased(let expiresDate):
            print("Product is purchased.")
        case .notPurchased:
            print("The user has never purchased this product")
        }
    case .error(let error):
        print("Receipt verification failed: \(error)")
    }
}
```

Note that for consumable products, the receipt will only include the information for a couples of minutes after the purchase.

### Verify Subscription

```swift
let appleValidator = AppleReceiptValidator(service: .production)
SwiftyStoreKit.verifyReceipt(using: appleValidator, password: "your-shared-secret") { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let receipt):
        // Verify the purchase of a Subscription
        let purchaseResult = SwiftyStoreKit.verifySubscription(
            productId: "com.musevisions.SwiftyStoreKit.Subscription",
            inReceipt: receipt,
            validUntil: NSDate(),
            validDuration: 3600 * 24 * 30 // Non Renewing Subscription only
        )
        switch purchaseResult {
        case .purchased(let expiresDate):
            print("Product is valid until \(expiresDate)")
        case .expired(let expiresDate):
            print("Product is expired since \(expiresDate)")
        case .notPurchased:
            print("The user has never purchased this product")
        }

    case .error(let error):
        print("Receipt verification failed: \(error)")
    }
}
```


To test the expiration of a Non Renewing Subscription, you must indicate the `validDuration` time interval in seconds.



**NOTE**:
The framework provides a simple block based API with robust error handling on top of the existing StoreKit framework. It does **NOT** persist in app purchases data locally. It is up to clients to do this with a storage solution of choice (i.e. NSUserDefaults, CoreData, Keychain).

## Installation

### CocoaPods

SwiftyStoreKit can be installed as a [CocoaPod](https://cocoapods.org/) and builds as a Swift framework. To install, include this in your Podfile.

```ruby
use_frameworks!

pod 'SwiftyStoreKit'
```
Once installed, just ```import SwiftyStoreKit``` in your classes and you're good to go.

## Payment flows - implementation Details
In order to make a purchase, two operations are needed:

- Perform a `SKProductRequest` to obtain the `SKProduct` corresponding to the product identifier.

- Submit the payment and listen for updated transactions on the `SKPaymentQueue`.

The framework takes care of caching SKProducts so that future requests for the same ```SKProduct``` don't need to perform a new ```SKProductRequest```.

### Payment queue

The following list outlines how requests are processed by SwiftyStoreKit.

* `SKPaymentQueue` is used to queue payments or restore purchases requests.
* Payments are processed serially and in-order and require user interaction.
* Restore purchases requests don't require user interaction and can jump ahead of the queue.
* `SKPaymentQueue` rejects multiple restore purchases calls.
* Failed translations only ever belong to queued payment request.
* `restoreCompletedTransactionsFailedWithError` is always called when a restore purchases request fails.
* `paymentQueueRestoreCompletedTransactionsFinished` is always called following 0 or more update transactions when a restore purchases request succeeds.
* A complete transactions handler is require to catch any transactions that are updated when the app is not running.
* Registering a complete transactions handler when the app launches ensures that any pending transactions can be cleared.
* If a complete transactions handler is missing, pending transactions can be mis-attributed to any new incoming payments or restore purchases.

The order in which transaction updates are processed is:

1. payments (transactionState: `.purchased` and `.failed` for matching product identifiers)
2. restore purchases (transactionState: `.restored`, or `restoreCompletedTransactionsFailedWithError`, or `paymentQueueRestoreCompletedTransactionsFinished`)
3. complete transactions (transactionState: `.purchased`, `.failed`, `.restored`, `.deferred`)

Any transactions where state == `.purchasing` are ignored.

See [this pull request](https://github.com/bizz84/SwiftyStoreKit/pull/131) for full details about how the payment flows have been implemented.
