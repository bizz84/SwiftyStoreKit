## About Xcode 9 / Swift 4.x

#### Development has started on the [swift-4.0](https://github.com/bizz84/SwiftyStoreKit/tree/swift-4.0) branch, aiming to have a compilable version of SwiftyStoreKit on Xcode 9 betas.

## App startup

### Complete Transactions

Apple recommends to register a transaction observer [as soon as the app starts](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2387/_index.html):
> Adding your app's observer at launch ensures that it will persist during all launches of your app, thus allowing your app to receive all the payment queue notifications.

SwiftyStoreKit supports this by calling `completeTransactions()` when the app starts:

```swift
func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {

	SwiftyStoreKit.completeTransactions(atomically: true) { purchases in
	
	    for purchase in purchases {
	
	        if purchase.transaction.transactionState == .purchased || purchase.transaction.transactionState == .restored {
	
               if purchase.needsFinishTransaction {
                   // Deliver content from server, then:
                   SwiftyStoreKit.finishTransaction(purchase.transaction)
               }
               print("purchased: \(purchase)")
	        }
	    }
	}
 	return true
}
```

If there are any pending transactions at this point, these will be reported by the completion block so that the app state and UI can be updated.

If there are no pending transactions, the completion block will **not** be called.

Note that `completeTransactions()` **should only be called once** in your code, in `application(:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`.

In addition, at any point in time, array of unfinished transactions on the payment queue can be accessed via `SwiftyStoreKit.unhandledTransactions`. Only valid while the queue has observers.

## Purchases

### Retrieve products info
```swift
SwiftyStoreKit.retrieveProductsInfo(["com.musevisions.SwiftyStoreKit.Purchase1"]) { result in
    if let product = result.retrievedProducts.first {
        let priceString = product.localizedPrice!
        print("Product: \(product.localizedDescription), price: \(priceString)")
    }
    else if let invalidProductId = result.invalidProductIDs.first {
        return alertWithTitle("Could not retrieve product info", message: "Invalid product identifier: \(invalidProductId)")
    }
    else {
	     print("Error: \(result.error)")
    }
}
```

### Purchase a product (given a product id)

* **Atomic**: to be used when the content is delivered immediately.

```swift
SwiftyStoreKit.purchaseProduct("com.musevisions.SwiftyStoreKit.Purchase1", quantity: 1, atomically: true) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let purchase):
        print("Purchase Success: \(purchase.productId)")
    case .error(let error):
        switch error.code {
        case .unknown: print("Unknown error. Please contact support")
        case .clientInvalid: print("Not allowed to make the payment")
        case .paymentCancelled: break
        case .paymentInvalid: print("The purchase identifier was invalid")
        case .paymentNotAllowed: print("The device is not allowed to make the payment")
        case .storeProductNotAvailable: print("The product is not available in the current storefront")
        case .cloudServicePermissionDenied: print("Access to cloud service information is not allowed")
        case .cloudServiceNetworkConnectionFailed: print("Could not connect to the network")
        case .cloudServiceRevoked: print("User has revoked permission to use this cloud service")
        }
    }
}
```

* **Non-Atomic**: to be used when the content is delivered by the server.

```swift
SwiftyStoreKit.purchaseProduct("com.musevisions.SwiftyStoreKit.Purchase1", quantity: 1, atomically: false) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let product):
        // fetch content from your server, then:
        if product.needsFinishTransaction {
            SwiftyStoreKit.finishTransaction(product.transaction)
        }
        print("Purchase Success: \(product.productId)")
    case .error(let error):
        switch error.code {
        case .unknown: print("Unknown error. Please contact support")
        case .clientInvalid: print("Not allowed to make the payment")
        case .paymentCancelled: break
        case .paymentInvalid: print("The purchase identifier was invalid")
        case .paymentNotAllowed: print("The device is not allowed to make the payment")
        case .storeProductNotAvailable: print("The product is not available in the current storefront")
        case .cloudServicePermissionDenied: print("Access to cloud service information is not allowed")
        case .cloudServiceNetworkConnectionFailed: print("Could not connect to the network")
        case .cloudServiceRevoked: print("User has revoked permission to use this cloud service")
        }
    }
}
```

### Purchase a product (given a SKProduct)

This is a variant of the method above that can be used to purchase a product when the corresponding `SKProduct` has already been retrieved with `retrieveProductsInfo`: 

```swift
SwiftyStoreKit.retrieveProductsInfo(["com.musevisions.SwiftyStoreKit.Purchase1"]) { result in
    if let product = result.retrievedProducts.first {
        SwiftyStoreKit.purchaseProduct(product, quantity: 1, atomically: true) { result in
            // handle result (same as above)
        }
    }
}
```

Using this `purchaseProduct` method guarantees that only one network call is made to StoreKit to perform the purchase, as opposed to one call to get the product and another to perform the purchase.

### Restore previous purchases

According to [Apple - Restoring Purchased Products](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/StoreKitGuide/Chapters/Restoring.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008267-CH8-SW9):

> In most cases, all your app needs to do is refresh its receipt and deliver the products in its receipt. The refreshed receipt contains a record of the user’s purchases in this app, on this device or any other device.

> Restoring completed transactions creates a new transaction for every completed transaction the user made, essentially replaying history for your transaction queue observer.

See the **Receipt Verification** section below for how to restore previous purchases using the receipt.

This section shows how to restore completed transactions with the `restorePurchases` method instead.

* **Atomic**: to be used when the content is delivered immediately.

```swift
SwiftyStoreKit.restorePurchases(atomically: true) { results in
    if results.restoreFailedPurchases.count > 0 {
        print("Restore Failed: \(results.restoreFailedPurchases)")
    }
    else if results.restoredPurchases.count > 0 {
        print("Restore Success: \(results.restoredPurchases)")
    }
    else {
        print("Nothing to Restore")
    }
}
```

* **Non-Atomic**: to be used when the content is delivered by the server.

```swift
SwiftyStoreKit.restorePurchases(atomically: false) { results in
    if results.restoreFailedPurchases.count > 0 {
        print("Restore Failed: \(results.restoreFailedPurchases)")
    }
    else if results.restoredPurchases.count > 0 {
        for purchase in results.restoredPurchases {
            // fetch content from your server, then:
            if purchase.needsFinishTransaction {
                SwiftyStoreKit.finishTransaction(purchase.transaction)
            }
        }
        print("Restore Success: \(results.restoredPurchases)")
    }
    else {
        print("Nothing to Restore")
    }
}
```

#### What does atomic / non-atomic mean?

When you purchase a product the following things happen:

* A payment is added to the payment queue for your IAP.
* When the payment has been processed with Apple, the payment queue is updated so that the appropriate transaction can be handled.
* If the transaction state is **purchased** or **restored**, the app can unlock the functionality purchased by the user.
* The app should call `finishTransaction(_:)` to complete the purchase.

This is what is [recommended by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/reference/storekit/skpaymentqueue/1506003-finishtransaction):

> Your application should call `finishTransaction(_:)` only after it has successfully processed the transaction and unlocked the functionality purchased by the user.

* A purchase is **atomic** when the app unlocks the functionality purchased by the user immediately and call `finishTransaction(_:)` at the same time. This is desirable if you're unlocking functionality that is already inside the app.

* In cases when you need to make a request to your own server in order to unlock the functionality, you can use a **non-atomic** purchase instead.

* **Note**: SwiftyStoreKit doesn't yet support downloading content hosted by Apple for non-consumable products. See [this feature request](https://github.com/bizz84/SwiftyStoreKit/issues/128).

SwiftyStoreKit provides three operations that can be performed **atomically** or **non-atomically**:

* Making a purchase
* Restoring purchases
* Completing transactions on app launch

## Receipt verification

According to [Apple - Delivering Products](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/StoreKitGuide/Chapters/DeliverProduct.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008267-CH5-SW4):

> The app receipt contains a record of the user’s purchases, cryptographically signed by Apple. For more information, see [Receipt Validation Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/General/ValidateAppStoreReceipt/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010573).

> Information about consumable products is added to the receipt when they’re paid for and remains in the receipt until you finish the transaction. After you finish the transaction, this information is removed the next time the receipt is updated—for example, the next time the user makes a purchase.

> Information about all other kinds of purchases is added to the receipt when they’re paid for and remains in the receipt indefinitely.

When an app is first installed, the app receipt is missing.

As soon as a user completes a purchase or restores purchases, StoreKit creates and stores the receipt locally as a file.

As the local receipt is always encrypted, a verification step is needed to get all the receipt fields in readable form.

This is done with a `verifyReceipt` method which does two things:

- If the receipt is missing, refresh it
- If the receipt is available or is refreshed, validate it

Receipt validation can be done remotely with Apple via the `AppleReceiptValidator` class, or with a client-supplied validator conforming to the `ReceiptValidator` protocol. 

**Notes**

* If the local receipt is missing when calling `verifyReceipt`, a network call is made to refresh it.
* If the user is not logged to the App Store, StoreKit will present a popup asking to **Sign In to the iTunes Store**.
* If the user enters valid credentials, the receipt will be refreshed and verified.
* If the user cancels, receipt refresh will fail with a **Cannot connect to iTunes Store** error.
* Using `AppleReceiptValidator` (see below) does remote receipt validation and also results in a network call.
* Local receipt validation is not implemented (see [issue #101](https://github.com/bizz84/SwiftyStoreKit/issues/101) for details).


### Retrieve local receipt

```swift
let receiptData = SwiftyStoreKit.localReceiptData
let receiptString = receiptData.base64EncodedString(options: [])
// do your receipt validation here
```

### Verify Receipt

```swift
let appleValidator = AppleReceiptValidator(service: .production)
SwiftyStoreKit.verifyReceipt(using: appleValidator, password: "your-shared-secret", forceRefresh: false) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let receipt):
        print("Verify receipt Success: \(receipt)")
    case .error(let error):
        print("Verify receipt Failed: \(error)")
	}
}
```

Note: you can specify `forceRefresh: true` to force SwiftyStoreKit to refresh the receipt with Apple, even if a local receipt is already stored.

## Verifying purchases and subscriptions

Once you have retrieved the receipt using the `verifyReceipt` method, you can verify your purchases and subscriptions by product identifier.

Verifying multiple purchases and subscriptions in one call is not yet supported (see [issue #194](https://github.com/bizz84/SwiftyStoreKit/issues/194) for more details).

If you need to verify multiple purchases / subscriptions, you can either:

* manually parse the receipt dictionary returned by `verifyReceipt`
* call `verifyPurchase` or `verifySubscription` multiple times with different product identifiers

### Verify Purchase

```swift
let appleValidator = AppleReceiptValidator(service: .production)
SwiftyStoreKit.verifyReceipt(using: appleValidator, password: "your-shared-secret") { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let receipt):
        // Verify the purchase of Consumable or NonConsumable
        let purchaseResult = SwiftyStoreKit.verifyPurchase(
            productId: "com.musevisions.SwiftyStoreKit.Purchase1",
            inReceipt: receipt)
            
        switch purchaseResult {
        case .purchased(let receiptItem):
            print("Product is purchased: \(receiptItem)")
        case .notPurchased:
            print("The user has never purchased this product")
        }
    case .error(let error):
        print("Receipt verification failed: \(error)")
    }
}
```

Note that for consumable products, the receipt will only include the information for a couple of minutes after the purchase.

### Verify Subscription

This can be used to check if a subscription was previously purchased, and whether it is still active or if it's expired.

From [Apple - Working with Subscriptions](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/StoreKitGuide/Chapters/Subscriptions.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008267-CH7-SW6):

> keep a record of the date that each piece of content is published. Read the Original Purchase Date and Subscription Expiration Date field from each receipt entry to determine the start and end dates of the subscription.

When one or more subscriptions are found for a given product id, they are returned as a `ReceiptItem` array ordered by `expiryDate`, with the first one being the newest.

```swift
let appleValidator = AppleReceiptValidator(service: .production)
SwiftyStoreKit.verifyReceipt(using: appleValidator, password: "your-shared-secret") { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let receipt):
        // Verify the purchase of a Subscription
        let purchaseResult = SwiftyStoreKit.verifySubscription(
            type: .autoRenewable, // or .nonRenewing (see below)
            productId: "com.musevisions.SwiftyStoreKit.Subscription",
            inReceipt: receipt)
            
        switch purchaseResult {
        case .purchased(let expiryDate, let receiptItems):
            print("Product is valid until \(expiryDate)")
        case .expired(let expiryDate, let receiptItems):
            print("Product is expired since \(expiryDate)")
        case .notPurchased:
            print("The user has never purchased this product")
        }

    case .error(let error):
        print("Receipt verification failed: \(error)")
    }
}
```

#### Auto-Renewable
```swift
let purchaseResult = SwiftyStoreKit.verifySubscription(
            type: .autoRenewable,
            productId: "com.musevisions.SwiftyStoreKit.Subscription",
            inReceipt: receipt)
```

#### Non-Renewing
```swift
// validDuration: time interval in seconds
let purchaseResult = SwiftyStoreKit.verifySubscription(
            type: .nonRenewing(validDuration: 3600 * 24 * 30),
            productId: "com.musevisions.SwiftyStoreKit.Subscription",
            inReceipt: receipt)
```

**Notes**

* The expiration dates are calculated against the receipt date. This is the date of the last successful call to `verifyReceipt`.
* When purchasing subscriptions in sandbox mode, the expiry dates are set just minutes after the purchase date for testing purposes.

#### Purchasing and verifying a subscription 

The `verifySubscription` method can be used together with the `purchaseProduct` method to purchase a subscription and check its expiration date, like so:

```swift
let productId = "your-product-id"
SwiftyStoreKit.purchaseProduct(productId, atomically: true) { result in
    
    if case .success(let purchase) = result {
        // Deliver content from server, then:
        if purchase.needsFinishTransaction {
            SwiftyStoreKit.finishTransaction(purchase.transaction)
        }
        
        let appleValidator = AppleReceiptValidator(service: .production)
        SwiftyStoreKit.verifyReceipt(using: appleValidator, password: "your-shared-secret") { result in
            
            if case .success(let receipt) = result {
                let purchaseResult = SwiftyStoreKit.verifySubscription(
                    type: .autoRenewable,
                    productId: productId,
                    inReceipt: receipt)
                
                switch purchaseResult {
                case .purchased(let expiryDate, let receiptItems):
                    print("Product is valid until \(expiryDate)")
                case .expired(let expiryDate, let receiptItems):
                    print("Product is expired since \(expiryDate)")
                case .notPurchased:
                    print("This product has never been purchased")
                }

            } else {
                // receipt verification error
            }
        }
    } else {
        // purchase error
    }
}
```


## Notes
The framework provides a simple block based API with robust error handling on top of the existing StoreKit framework. It does **NOT** persist in app purchases data locally. It is up to clients to do this with a storage solution of choice (i.e. NSUserDefaults, CoreData, Keychain).

## Installation

### CocoaPods

SwiftyStoreKit can be installed as a [CocoaPod](https://cocoapods.org/) and builds as a Swift framework. To install, include this in your Podfile.

```ruby
use_frameworks!

pod 'SwiftyStoreKit'
```
Once installed, just ```import SwiftyStoreKit``` in your classes and you're good to go.

### Carthage

To integrate SwiftyStoreKit into your Xcode project using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), specify it in your Cartfile:

```ogdl
github "bizz84/SwiftyStoreKit"
```

**NOTE**: Please ensure that you have the [latest](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases) Carthage installed.

## Payment flows - implementation Details
In order to make a purchase, two operations are needed:

- Perform a `SKProductRequest` to obtain the `SKProduct` corresponding to the product identifier.

- Submit the payment and listen for updated transactions on the `SKPaymentQueue`.

The framework takes care of caching SKProducts so that future requests for the same `SKProduct` don't need to perform a new `SKProductRequest`.

### Payment queue

The following list outlines how requests are processed by SwiftyStoreKit.

* `SKPaymentQueue` is used to queue payments or restore purchases requests.
* Payments are processed serially and in-order and require user interaction.
* Restore purchases requests don't require user interaction and can jump ahead of the queue.
* `SKPaymentQueue` rejects multiple restore purchases calls.
* Failed transactions only ever belong to queued payment requests.
* `restoreCompletedTransactionsFailedWithError` is always called when a restore purchases request fails.
* `paymentQueueRestoreCompletedTransactionsFinished` is always called following 0 or more update transactions when a restore purchases request succeeds.
* A complete transactions handler is require to catch any transactions that are updated when the app is not running.
* Registering a complete transactions handler when the app launches ensures that any pending transactions can be cleared.
* If a complete transactions handler is missing, pending transactions can be mis-attributed to any new incoming payments or restore purchases.

The order in which transaction updates are processed is:

1. payments (transactionState: `.purchased` and `.failed` for matching product identifiers)
2. restore purchases (transactionState: `.restored`, or `restoreCompletedTransactionsFailedWithError`, or `paymentQueueRestoreCompletedTransactionsFinished`)
3. complete transactions (transactionState: `.purchased`, `.failed`, `.restored`, `.deferred`)

Any transactions where state is `.purchasing` are ignored.

See [this pull request](https://github.com/bizz84/SwiftyStoreKit/pull/131) for full details about how the payment flows have been implemented.
