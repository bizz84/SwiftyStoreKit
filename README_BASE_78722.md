### Setup + Complete Transactions

Apple recommends to register a transaction observer [as soon as the app starts](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2387/_index.html):
> Adding your app's observer at launch ensures that it will persist during all launches of your app, thus allowing your app to receive all the payment queue notifications.

SwiftyStoreKit supports this by calling `completeTransactions()` when the app starts:

```swift
func application(application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {

	SwiftyStoreKit.completeTransactions() { completedTransactions in
	
	    for completedTransaction in completedTransactions {
	
	        if completedTransaction.transactionState == .Purchased || completedTransaction.transactionState == .Restored {
	
	            print("purchased: \(completedTransaction.productId)")
	        }
	    }
	}
}
```

If there are any pending transactions at this point, these will be reported by the completion block so that the app state and UI can be updated.

### Retrieve products info
```swift
SwiftyStoreKit.retrieveProductsInfo(["com.musevisions.SwiftyStoreKit.Purchase1"]) { result in
    if let product = result.retrievedProducts.first {
        let priceString = NSNumberFormatter.localizedStringFromNumber(product.price ?? 0, numberStyle: .CurrencyStyle)
        print("Product: \(product.localizedDescription), price: \(priceString)")
    }
    else if let invalidProductId = result.invalidProductIDs.first {
        return alertWithTitle("Could not retrieve product info", message: "Invalid product identifier: \(invalidProductId)")
    }
    else {
	     print("Error: \(result.error)")
    }
}
```
### Purchase a product

```swift
SwiftyStoreKit.purchaseProduct("com.musevisions.SwiftyStoreKit.Purchase1") { result in
    switch result {
    case .Success(let productId):
        print("Purchase Success: \(productId)")
    case .Error(let error):
        print("Purchase Failed: \(error)")
    }
}
```

### Restore previous purchases

```swift
SwiftyStoreKit.restorePurchases() { results in
    if results.restoreFailedProducts.count > 0 {
        print("Restore Failed: \(results.restoreFailedProducts)")
    }
    else if results.restoredProductIds.count > 0 {
        print("Restore Success: \(results.restoredProductIds)")
    }
    else {
        print("Nothing to Restore")
    }
}
```

### Verify Receipt

```swift
SwiftyStoreKit.verifyReceipt() { result in
    if case .Error(let error) = result {
        if case .NoReceiptData = error {
            self.refreshReceipt()
        }
    }
}

func refreshReceipt() {
    SwiftyStoreKit.refreshReceipt { result in
        switch result {
        case .Success:
            print("Receipt refresh success")
        case .Error(let error):
            print("Receipt refresh failed: \(error)")
        }
    }
}
```

When using auto-renewable subscriptions, the shared secret can be specified like so:

```
SwiftyStoreKit.verifyReceipt(password: "your_shared_secret")
```

### Verify Purchase

```swift
SwiftyStoreKit.verifyReceipt() { result in
    switch result {
    case .Success(let receipt):
        // Verify the purchase of Consumable or NonConsumable
        let purchaseResult = SwiftyStoreKit.verifyPurchase(
            productId: "com.musevisions.SwiftyStoreKit.Purchase1",
            inReceipt: receipt
        )
        switch purchaseResult {
        case .Purchased(let expiresDate):
            print("Product is purchased.")
        case .NotPurchased:
            print("The user has never purchased this product")
        }
    case .Error(let error):
        print("Receipt verification failed: \(error)")
    }
}
```

Note that for consumable products, the receipt will only include the information for a couples of minutes after the purchase.

### Verify Subscription

```swift
SwiftyStoreKit.verifyReceipt() { result in
    switch result {
    case .Success(let receipt):
        // Verify the purchase of a Subscription
        let purchaseResult = SwiftyStoreKit.verifySubscription(
            productId: "com.musevisions.SwiftyStoreKit.Subscription",
            inReceipt: receipt,
            validUntil: NSDate()
            validDuration: 3600 * 24 * 30, // Non Renewing Subscription only
        )
        switch purchaseResult {
        case .Purchased(let expiresDate):
            print("Product is valid until \(expiresDate)")
        case .Expired(let expiresDate):
            print("Product is expired since \(expiresDate)")
        case .NotPurchased:
            print("The user has never purchased this product")
        }

    case .Error(let error):
        print("Receipt verification failed: \(error)")
    }
}
```


To test the expiration of a Non Renewing Subscription, you must indicate the `validDuration` time interval in seconds.



**NOTE**:
The framework provides a simple block based API with robust error handling on top of the existing StoreKit framework. It does **NOT** persist in app purchases data locally. It is up to clients to do this with a storage solution of choice (i.e. NSUserDefaults, CoreData, Keychain).

## Installation

### CocoaPods

SwiftyStoreKit can be installed as a [CocoaPod](https://cocoapods.org/) and builds as a Swift framework. To install, include this in your Podfile.

```ruby
use_frameworks!

pod 'SwiftyStoreKit'
```
Once installed, just ```import SwiftyStoreKit``` in your classes and you're good to go.

### Carthage

To integrate SwiftyStoreKit into your Xcode project using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), specify it in your Cartfile:

```ogdl
github "bizz84/SwiftyStoreKit"
```

**NOTE**: Please ensure that you have the [latest](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases) Carthage installed.


## Sample Code
The project includes demo apps [for iOS](https://github.com/bizz84/SwiftyStoreKit/blob/master/SwiftyStoreDemo/ViewController.swift) [and OSX](https://github.com/bizz84/SwiftyStoreKit/blob/master/SwiftyStoreOSXDemo/ViewController.swift) showing how to use SwiftyStoreKit.
Note that the pre-registered in app purchases in the demo apps are for illustration purposes only and may not work as iTunes Connect may invalidate them.

#### Features
- Super easy to use block based API
- Support for consumable, non-consumable in-app purchases
- Support for free, auto renewable and non renewing subscriptions
- Receipt verification
- iOS, tvOS and OS X compatible
- enum-based error handling

## Known issues

#### Requests lifecycle

While SwiftyStoreKit tries handle concurrent purchase or restore purchases requests, it is not guaranteed that this will always work flawlessly.
This is in part because using a closure-based API does not map perfectly well with the lifecycle of payments in `SKPaymentQueue`.

In real applications the following could happen:

1. User starts a purchase
2. User kills the app
3. OS continues processing this, resulting in a failed or successful purchase
4. App is restarted (payment queue is not updated yet)
5. User starts another purchase (the old transaction may interfere with the new purchase)

To prevent situations like this from happening, a `completeTransactions()` method has been added in version 0.2.8. This should be called when the app starts as it can take care of clearing the payment queue and notifying the app of the transactions that have finished.

#### Multiple accounts

The user can background the hosting application and change the Apple ID used with the App Store, then foreground the app. This has been observed to cause problems with SwiftyStoreKit - other IAP implementations may suffer from this as well.


## Changelog

#### Version 0.3.0

* Fixed the `verifyReceipt()` method to use production environment by default. This falls back to the test environment if the receipt is a sandbox receipt.

#### Version 0.2.10

* Added **tvOS** support
* Faster compilation time for `verifySubscription()` implementation

#### Version 0.2.9

* Added support for verifying purchases and subscriptions. This includes consumable and non consumable purchases, auto-renewing, free and non-renewing subscriptions.
* The `purchaseProduct()` now takes an optional `applicationUsername` string which can be used to help detect irregular activity on transactions. Read more about this on the [Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/StoreKitGuide/Chapters/RequestPayment.html).
* Updated `verifyReceipt()` so that the completion block is called on the main thread.


#### Version 0.2.8

* Added `completeTransactions()` method to clear payment queue and return information about payments that have completed / failed.

#### Version 0.2.7

* Fixed **critical issue** that was causing the callbacks for `purchaseProduct()` and `restorePurchases()` to get mixed up when multiple requests were running concurrently. Related issues: [#3](https://github.com/bizz84/SwiftyStoreKit/issues/3), [#22](https://github.com/bizz84/SwiftyStoreKit/issues/22), [#26](https://github.com/bizz84/SwiftyStoreKit/issues/26). _Note that while code analysis and various testing scenarios indicate that this is now resolved, this has not yet been confirmed by the reporters of the issues._

#### Version 0.2.6

* Retrieve multiple products info at once. Introduces the new `retrieveProductsInfo()` API call, which takes a set of product IDs and returns a struct with information about the corresponding SKProducts. [Related issue #21](https://github.com/bizz84/SwiftyStoreKit/issues/21)

#### Version 0.2.5

* The `restorePurchases()` completion closure has been changed to return all restored purchases in one call. [Related issue #18](https://github.com/bizz84/SwiftyStoreKit/issues/18)

#### Version 0.2.4

* Carthage compatible
* Fixed Swift 2.2 warnings

#### Previous versions

* Receipt verification
* OS X support

## Implementation Details
In order to make a purchase, two operations are needed:

- Obtain the ```SKProduct``` corresponding to the productId that identifies the app purchase, via ```SKProductRequest```.

- Submit the payment for that product via ```SKPaymentQueue```.

The framework takes care of caching SKProducts so that future requests for the same ```SKProduct``` don't need to perform a new ```SKProductRequest```.

### Requesting products information

SwiftyStoreKit wraps the delegate-based ```SKProductRequest``` API with a block based class named ```InAppProductQueryRequest```, which returns a `RetrieveResults` value with information about the obtained products:

```swift
public struct RetrieveResults {
    public let retrievedProducts: Set<SKProduct>
    public let invalidProductIDs: Set<String>
    public let error: NSError?
}
```
This value is then surfaced back to the caller of the `retrieveProductsInfo()` method the completion closure so that the client can update accordingly.

### Purchasing a product / Restoring purchases
`InAppProductPurchaseRequest` is a wrapper class for `SKPaymentQueue` that can be used to purchase a product or restore purchases.

The class conforms to the `SKPaymentTransactionObserver` protocol in order to receive transactions notifications from the payment queue. The following outcomes are defined for a purchase/restore action:

```swift
enum TransactionResult {
    case Purchased(productId: String)
    case Restored(productId: String)
    case Failed(error: NSError)
}
```
Depending on the operation, the completion closure for `InAppProductPurchaseRequest` is then mapped to either a `PurchaseResult` or a `RestoreResults` value and returned to the caller.
